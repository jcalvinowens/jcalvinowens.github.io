<figcaption>10m Yagi</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I have a 3-element 10m Yagi with a rotator, which is about 20ft above ground.
The mast is electrical conduit, and the guy wires are 1/8" steel. I set this up
mid-July 2019, after I got bored with being to work mostly the same locations
with my fixed dipole.</p>

<p>This works as well as you could expect it to work at the solar minimium: I
get very sporadic contacts, but when I do I rarely need more than 10W on FT8.
The noise floor to the East is S3-S4 lately, which I think is the limiting thing
right now. To the West it tends to be S0-S1, but it's unclear if that's because
nobody lives in the middle of the ocean or RFI. There's a big run of 250KV power
lines about 1/2 mile to the East, which I also think might hurt.</p>

<p>All in all, this has been a fun experiment, but I'm not sure I'll put it up
again after I take it down to move: the dipole was a lot more practical.</p>

<p>So far, I've just been having fun seeing how well FT8 can work on random wire
antennas with low power.</p>

<figcaption>Non-resonant HF Dipole</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For my first couple years on HF, I used an "all-band" 102ft (31m) horizontal
dipole antenna, which was strung North-South with the North end pointed about
five degrees West of North. The North end was 17ft (5m) off the ground, and the
South end was at 25ft (8m). The wire was #14 (1.6mm) uninsulated copper.</p>

<p><a href="gen/old/all-contacts.html">Click here</a> for a list of all contacts
I made with the old antenna, confirmed and unconfirmed.</p>

</figure>

<p>You might recognize the length as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G5RV_antenna">
G5RV</a> antenna: that length works well because it's "equally bad" for all the
amateur radio bands, but it didn't have the correct ground clearance or length
of ladder line to really be called a "G5RV".</p>

<p>The full run was about 240ft, with the antenna strung between rope on ceremic
insulators. It was tied off to a TV satellite dish on the north end of the roof,
and threaded through a pulley in the tree to a hanging cinderblock counterweight
on the south end.</p>

<p>I had lots of success all the way up to 15m (21MHz). Beyond that, the
radiation pattern starts to distort North due to the slope of the antenna, and
that's not where you want to point for success at those high frequencies. I
rarely made non-line-of-sight contacts on these bands.</p>

<p>The antenna was fed with ~30ft of 450 Ohm ladder line, which ran down at a
45-degree angle north for 15ft and then just out of reach parallel to the ground
into the shack, located under the center of the north leg. The ladder line ran
through a knife switch (for grounding it when not in use) to a manual T-network
antenna coupler, which had a built-in 1:1 current balun.</p>

<p>The manual antenna coupler was a little silly, but since I generally stuck to
FT8 I just had a table of the right settings and it was quick enough. One of the
benefits is that you don't have to worry about pushing it as much, since the
capacitors will arc before anything else (unlike an L-network coupler where you
can ruin the ferrite). It could tune any frequency I ever tried to 2:1 or
better.</p>

<p>The ladder line was an important part of making this work: the antenna had
extremely high impedence at several of the frequencies I liked to use it on, so
the loss in coax would be untenable (and the voltage might actually exceed its
tolerance).<p>

<p>This is all a nice demonstration of how resonance doesn't matter much on HF,
especially lower HF: if you can hear the noise, it's good enough. The coupler
exists only to present the 50 Ohm load the transmitter was designed for.</p>

<p>The below plots show all FT8 contacts made with this old antenna. All
distances are in miles, and the colors run through the rainbow from 160m to 6m.
<a href="https://github.com/jcalvinowens/miscellaneous/tree/master/radio/hamwebutil.py">
This python script</a> (which uses <a href="https://github.com/jcalvinowens/miscellaneous/tree/master/radio/adifutil.py">
this python script</a>) generates them from ADIF files. It's kind of a mess.</p>

<p>The first set just show the location of contacts at three different "zoom"
levels.</p>

<p>The next set are scatterplots of signal reports on each band: the first shows
the signal report I received (e.g. how well they heard me) as a function of
distance (log x-axis), and the second shows it as a function of the signal
report I sent (e.g. how well I heard them).</p>

circle by time of day rather than the direction. The really good DX I got on 40m
consistently around sunrise sticks out.</p>
